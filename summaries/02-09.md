* Sound Overview
  * Travels through physical mediums as a wave.
  * Captured by microphones into an analog signal.
  * "Sampled" into digital signals.
    * Phones: 8Khz
    * CDs: 44.1Khz
    * Nyquist frequency = 1/2 of captured signal, required to avoid aliasing.
    * Aliasing: when a sound is under-sampled and a different frequency is captured.
    * Human ear can hear up to about 20Khz.
  * [ESynth](https://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/resource/sfs/esynth.php)
    * Double frequency, get octaves.
    * ["Missing Fundamental"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_fundamental) perceptual phenomenon.
