* Digital Sound Representation
  * How many bits? Depends on quality.
  * Too few bits results in "quantization noise.""
  * Phones: 8Khz
    * 8 bits/sample
    * Usually uses logarithmic scale for better resolution around 0, resulting in 12 bps
  * CDs: 44.1Khz
    * 16 bps
    * How much memory for 2 min song? `44100 * 16 * 2 * 120` (2 is for stereo)
* Everything can be broken down into sin waves.
  * Sound Waves -- time domain
  * Images -- space domain
  * Spectrum -- frequency domain
